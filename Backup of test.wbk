 'Page 6: Introduction to Investment Management I’M Welcome–Investment Management Expectation Introduction  Introduction to Investment Management Why Investment Management?Introduction Investment Managementis designed to help you: to make informed decisions, not only when buying stocks but also when investing in bonds, mutual funds, or any other investment. to understand the risks inherent in investing and to give the tools you need to answer the fundamental questions that help shape a sound investment strategy. What are the best investments for me? Should I buy individual securities, mutual funds, or ETFs? How do I make judgments about risk? Do I need professional help with my investments? Can I afford it?Fundamental Principle in Investing: There is a tradeoff between an investment’s risk and return.12/ 21Investment Management'
 'Page 7: Introduction to Investment Management What is an investment?Introduction An investment is any asset into which investors can place funds with the expectation of generating positive income and/or increasing their value. The returns from investing are received either as incomeor as increased value.  A collection of different investments is called a portfolio. Some of the attributes that distinguish one type of investment from another include whether the investment is: a security or property;  direct or indirect;  debt, equity, or derivative;  low risk or high risk;  short-term or long-term;  domestic or foreign.13/ 21Investment Management Introduction to Investment Management The Investment Process Introduction 14/ 21Investment Management'
 'Page 8: Introduction to Investment Management The Investment Process Introduction The investment process brings together suppliers who have extra funds (households that spend less than their income have savings, and they want to invest those surplus funds to earn a return) and demanderswho need funds (governments that often spend more than they take in through tax revenue, and firms that issue debt or equity securities to finance new investments and other activities).  Suppliers and demanders of funds usually come together by means of financial intermediaries. Financial institutions are organizations that pool the resources of households and other savers and use those funds to make loans and to invest in securities. Financial marketsare markets in which suppliers and demanders of funds trade financial assets, typically with the assistance of intermediaries such as securities brokers and dealers. 15/ 21Investment Management Introduction to Investment Management The Investment Process Individual investorsmanage their own funds to achieve their financial goals and usually concentrate on earning a return on idle funds, building a source of retirement income, and providing security for their families.  Individuals who lack the time or expertise to make investment decisions often employ institutional investors—investment professionals who earn their living by managing other people’s money. These professionals trade large volumes of securities for individuals, as well as for businesses and governments.  Institutional investors include banks, life insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds and generally control larger sums of money and have more sophisticated analytical skills than do most individual investors.Introduction 16/ 21Investment Management'
 'Page 9: Introduction to Investment Management Types of Investments Introduction Short-term investmentshave low risk and are used to earn a return on temporarily idle funds, to serve as a primary investment for conservative investors, and to provide liquidity.  Common stocksoffer dividends and capital gains.  Fixed-income securities—bonds, convertible securities, and preferred stock—offer fixed periodic returns with some potential for gain in value.  Mutual fundsallow investors to buy or sell interests in a professionally managed, diversified group of securities.  Exchange-traded fundsare similar to mutual funds except that they can be bought and sold on an exchange during the trading day.17/ 21Investment Management Introduction to Investment Management Types of Investments Introduction Hedge fundsare similar to mutual funds except that they are open only to relatively wealthy investors, tend to make riskier investments, and are subject to less regulation than mutual funds.  Derivative securitiessuch as options and futures are high-risk investments.  Options offer an opportunity to buy or sell another security at a specified price over a given period of time.  Futures are contracts between a seller and a buyer for delivery of a specified commodity or financial instrument, at a specified future date, at an agreed-on price.  Other popular investments include tax-advantaged investments, real estate, and tangibles. 18/ 21Investment Management'

 'Page 12: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types of Equity Securities: Common Shares Equity Securities 12/ 56 Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and give investors a claim on its operating performance, the opportunity to participate in the corporate decision-making process, and a claim on the company’s net assets in the case of liquidation.  Callable common shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued.  Putable common shares give shareholders the right to sell the shares back to the issuer at a price specified when the shares are originally issued. Investment Management'

 'Page 14: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types of Equity Securities: Preference Shares Equity Securities 14/ 56 Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to their holders take precedence over any other payments.  Cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend payments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders; non-cumulative preference shares have no such provisions, implying that the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion.  Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount; non-participating preference shares allow investors to simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends in the event of liquidation. Investment Management'
 'Page 15: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types of Equity Securities: Private Equity Securities Equity Securities 15/ 56 Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in private placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets. There are three types of private equity investments:  venture capital leverage buyouts private investments in public equity (PIPEs)  Private equity investing has the objective of increasing the ability of the company’s management to focus on its operating activities for long-term value creation; the strategy is to take the “private” company “public” after certain profit and other benchmarks have been met.

 "Page 16: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types of Equity Securities: Depository Receipts Equity Securities 16/ 56 Depository receipts are securities that trade like ordinary shares on a local exchange but which represent an economic interest in a foreign company. They allow the publicly listed shares of foreign companies to be traded on an exchange outside their domestic market. American depository receipts (ADR) are US$ denominated securities trading much like standard US securities on US markets.  Global depository receipts (GDR) helps foreign companies to trade in any country's stock market (particularly Europe) other than the US stock market. Investment Management"
 'Page 17: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Stock (Common Shares) as an Investment Common shares are a popular investment choice for both individual and institutional investors because they may: increase in value over time and generate significant capital gains. provide a periodic income stream through dividends. Stock investment generates positive returns over long periods of time, mostly from capital gains, not dividends, but with a risk. Advantages of investing in stocks: typically outperform bonds by a wide margin (annual returns twice as the returns of high-grade corporate bonds over the last century). provide inflation protection (returns exceed over time the inflation rate). price and market information is easy to find in the news and financial media. Stocks are subject to various risks and their returns are hard to predict.Equity Securities 17/ 56Investment Management'

 'Page 19: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types of Value for a Stock Par (nominal) value: is an arbitrary amount assigned to a stock when it is first issued. represents a minimum value for the stock and is not very useful to investors. Book value: is the total shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet  of the company. is the difference between total assets and total liabilities. is directly influenced by management’s decision on net income. reflects the historical operating and financial decisions of management. Market value (capitalization): is the current price of the stock in the stock market. is indirectly influenced by management’s decision on taking positive NPV investment opportunities. reflects the different expectations of share traders about the future cash flows of the company (forward-looking).Equity Securities 19/ 56Investment Management'
 'Page 20: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types of Value for Common Stock Investment valueis the amount that investors think it is worth and probably the most important measure for a stockholder. Investment value is determined by a complex process of evaluating risk and return information to place a value on the stock that represents the maximum price an investor should be willing to pay for the issue: Common shares have higher expected return and risk than preference shares because there is more uncertainty about future dividends of common shares and because they are residual claims for the holders. Companies in the early phase of the life cycle typically reinvest earnings, so total return consists of capital gain only. Companies in the mature phase of the life cycle typically return earnings to investors, as cash dividends or share repurchases. Intrinsic value is a measure of the underlying worth of a share of stock.Equity Securities 20/ 56Investment Management'

 'Page 22: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types and Uses of Common Stock Income Stocks: are stocks with a long history of regularly paying higher-than-average dividends that tend to increase over time (typically public utilities or companies that offer limited growth potential). are ideal for investors seeking relatively safe and high level of current income. are subject to a fair amount of interest rate risk. Growth Stocks: are stocks issued by companies experiencing rapid growth in revenues and earnings that have sustained earnings growth well above general market and typically pay little or no dividends (e.g. Amazon, Apple, Starbucks). are ideal for investors looking for attractive capital gains, rather than dividends, and willing to bear more risk. are a riskier investment than income stocks because price may fall if earnings growth cannot be maintained, particularly in a down market. may include blue chip stocks as well as speculative stocks.Equity Securities 22/ 56Investment Management'
 'Page 23: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types and Uses of Common Stock Blue-Chip Stocks: are stocks issued by large, well-established firms, often industry leaders, with long track records of earning profits and paying dividends. some provide consistently high dividend yields (Mc Donald’s, Johnson & Johnson) and others are more growth-oriented (Nike, Procter & Gamble). are less risky than most stocks and appeal to investors who want to earn higher returns than bonds typically offer without taking a great deal of risk. Speculative Stocks: are stocks that offer potential for substantial price appreciation, but that lack sustained records of success. are highly risky (earnings may be uncertain or highly unstable) and are attractive particularly when the market is bullish. Tech Stocks: represent the technology sector of the market and most trade on NASDAQ. offer potential for very high returns but also involve considerable risk.Equity Securities 23/ 56Investment Management'
 'Page 24: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types and Uses of Common Stock Cyclical Stocks: are stocks issued by companies whose earnings are closely linked to the overall economy (that serve markets tied to capital equipment spending by business or to consumer spending –durable items) and whose price tends to move up and down with the business cycle. are best for investors willing to trade in and out of these stocks as the economy changes and tend end to do well when the economy is growing, especially in early stages of economic recovery. Defensive Stocks: are stocks that tend to hold their value, and even do well, when the economy starts to falter. include stocks of public utilities, industrial and consumer goods companies that produce or market stapes such as beverages, foods and drugs. are commonly used by aggressive investors looking for a “parking place” during a slow economy.Equity Securities 24/ 56Investment Management'
 'Page 25: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types and Uses of Common Stock U.S. stock market can be broken into three segments based on a stock’s market capitalization.

 'Page 26: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types and Uses of Common Stock Mid-Cap Stocks: are stocks of medium-sized companies with market capitalization between   $2 billion and $10 billion. provide opportunity for greater capital appreciation than large-cap stocks, but less price volatility than small-cap stocks. usually have long-term track records (e.g. Hasbro, Wendy’s). “baby blues” are a type of mid-cap stock that offers the same characteristics of blue chip stocks, except size, and are ideal for investors seeking quality long-term growth (e.g. Logitech, Garmin). Small-Cap Stocks: are stocks of small companies with market capitalizations less than $2 billion. generally have annual revenues of less than $250 million. usually not widely-traded, so liquidity is an issue. have potential for high returns that comes along with high-risk exposure.Equity Securities 26/ 56Investment Management'

 'Page 28: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Primary Markets of Equity Securities Public offerings Corporations sell equity securities to the public. Initial public offering (IPO)or placing is first public sale of equity securities. Seasoned offeringare made by issuers that want to sell additional units of a previously issued securities.

 'Page 29: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Primary Markets of Equity Securities (2) Book-building Underwriter sets a price range for the shares to be placed. Subscription period is preceded by a road-show(2 weeks). During the subscription period (usually one week), (institutional) investors are invited to place purchase commitments in an order book at prices inside the price range. The issue price is determined by monitoring the subscription orders received in the order book. In case of over-subscription, the underwriter has complete discretion to allocate the shares. In some countries, new issues are offered as double stage issue whereby a separate mechanism offers shares to the public, usually at a fixed price equal to the equilibrium price set during the book-building process.29/ 56Equity Securities Investment Management'
 'Page 30: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Primary Markets of Equity Securities (3) Fixed-price offerings Shares are offered to all categories of investors at a single and unchangeable price set in advance by the underwriter and filed in the introduction prospectus. Rationing rules (most often pro rata) are used to allocate shares. Auctions (tender offerings) Competitive bidding underwriting: issuer sets terms of issue (minimum price) and parties place subscription orders in the form of limit orders at prices above or equal to the minimum. Single-price (uniform-price) auction: all compatible orders are executed at a unique price equal to the equilibrium price (all bidders pay the highest winning yield/lowest winning price). Multiple-price (discriminatory or multiunit) auction: served orders are executed at the limit price they specify.30/ 56Equity Securities Investment Management'

The resulting economies of scale can significantly improve investment returns. Banks, insurance companies, and investment management firms, also known as sponsors, organise most pooled investment vehicles as business trusts, limited partnerships, orlimited liability companies.  The three main types of pooled investment vehiclesare: open-end mutual funds closed-end funds exchange-traded funds.  Important distinctions between pooled investment vehicles are whether they are exchange-traded or not and whether their managers use passive or active investment strategies.Investment Management'

When investors want to invest in a mutual fund, the fund issues new shares in exchange for cash that the investors deposit and when existing investors want to withdraw money, the fund redeems the investors’ shares and pays them cash.  The net asset value (NAV) of a fund is calculated by dividing the total net value of the fund (the value of all assets minus the value of all liabilities) by the fund’s current total number of shares outstanding.  Managers compute the fund’s NAV each day following the normal close of exchange market trading; they use last reported trade prices to value their portfolio securities and usually publish the NAVs a few hours after the market closes.

Aggressive-Growth Funds(performance funds) are highly speculative and often buy stocks of small, unseasoned companies, and stocks with relatively high price/earnings multiples and often invest in companies that are recovering from a period of very poor financial performance, and they may  even use leverage in their portfolios (i.e., buy stocks on margin). Value Fundsconfine their investing to stocks whose prices are trading below  intrinsic value, stocks with relatively low price-to-earnings ratios, high dividend yields, and moderate amounts of  financial leverage. Equity-Income Fundshave the objective of capital preservationand invest in stocks with high dividend yields, high-grade common stocks, some convertible securities and preferred stocks, and occasionally even junk bonds or certain types of high-grade foreign bonds.Investment Management'
 'Page 7: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Types of Mutual Funds (2)Pooled Investments 13/ 76 Balanced Fundstend to hold a balanced portfolio of both stocks and  bonds for the purpose of generating a balanced return of both current income and long-term capital gains; they’re much like equity-income funds, but balanced funds usually put more into fixed-income securities. Growth-and-Income Fundsalso seek a balanced return made up of both current income and long-term capital gains, but they place a greater  emphasis on growth of capital; put most into equities (80% to 90%).  Bond Fundsinvest exclusively in various types and  grades of bonds—from Treasury and agency bonds to corporate and municipal bonds  and other debt securities such as mortgage-backed securities; income from the bonds’  interest payments is the primary investment objective. Money Market Fundsinvest in short-term money market instruments—bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury bills, etc. and offer investors with modest amounts of capital access to the high-yielding money market,  where instruments require minimum investments of $100,000 or more.Investment Management Investment Instruments and Vehicles Index Funds Pooled Investments 14/ 76 An index fund is a portfolio of securities structured to track the returns of a specific index called the benchmark index.  An index fund is a passive investment strategybecause the index fund manager aims to replicate the benchmark index.  Index funds are generally broadly diversified and highly transparent, with relatively low management and trading costs, tax-efficient because they do not do a lot of trading that can generate taxable capital gains. Most individual investors and many institutional investors invest in index funds by buying open-end mutual funds that hold index portfolios; many large institutional investors create their own index funds.  Some index fund managers invest in every security in the benchmark index, a strategy known as full replication; if full replication is difficult or too costly, index fund managers might invest in only a representative sample of the index securities, a strategy called sampling replication.

Listed closed-end funds sell shares to the public in initial public offerings (IPOs) and use the proceeds from the IPO to purchase securities and other assets; after the IPO, investors who want to buy or sell a listed closed-end fund do so through exchanges and dealers. Listed closed-end funds are actively managed and generally trade at prices different from their NAV: A fund is said to trade at a discount if the trading price is lower than the fund’s NAV or at a premium if the trading price is greater than its NAV.  Discounts are more common than premiums because many closed-end fund investment managers have been unable to add more value to their funds than the funds lose through their various operational costs.Investment Management'

 'Page 10: Investment Instruments and Vehicles What is an alternative investment?Alternative Investments 19/ 76 Definitions of what constitutes an alternative investment vary considerably due to: purposes for which the definitions are being used new field for which consensus has not emerged rapidly changing field CFA Definition:  Alternative Investments are “alternatives to long-only positions in stocks, bonds and cash.”  They include investments in assets such as real estate and commodities (two of the oldest investment classes), but also non-traditional approaches to investing within special vehicles, such as private equity funds, hedge funds, and some exchange traded funds. Management of alternative investment is almost always active.Investment Management Investment Instruments and Vehicles What is an alternative investment?Alternative Investments 20/ 76 CAIA Definition –(1) Alternative Investments by Exclusion:  An alternative investment is broadly viewed as any investment that is not simply a long position in traditional investments (publicly traded equities, fixed-income securities, and cash).  Since investment (deferred consumption) covers a very broad spectrum, a more accurate definition requires more specificity -an institutional-quality alternative investment is the type of investment that financial institutions such as pension funds or endowments might include in their holdings because they are expected to deliver reasonable returns at an acceptable level of risk. Examples: a pension fund would be reluctant to hold baseball cards or stamps, or invest in very small or very speculative projects; brokerage firms are not focused on making long-term investments, but rather to hold securities so to provide services to their clients.Investment Management'

Example: Why since many mutual funds and hedge funds invest in publicly traded securities, last are considered alternative investments in comparison to the former that are usually considered traditional investments? Answer: Hedge funds are less regulated, oftenhave different compensation structures, and often have highly active and esoteric trading strategies or structures.Investment Management'
 'Page 12: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Structures among Alternative Investments Alternative Investments 23/ 76 Regulatory structure refers to the role of government, including both regulation and taxation, in influencing the nature of an investment. Securities structure refers to the structuring of cash flows through leverage and securitization (the process of transforming asset ownership into tradable units). Trading structure refers to the role of an investment vehicle’s investment managers in developing and implementing trading strategies. Compensation structure refers to the ways that organizational issues, especially compensation schemes, influence particular investments. Institutional structure refers to the financial markets and financial institutions related to a particular investment, such as whether the investment is publicly traded.Investment Management Investment Instruments and Vehicles Structures and Alternative Investment Types Alternative Investments 24/ 76 Real Assets such as natural resources and commodities tend to have relatively fewer influences from structures, although value and management of natural resources are often subject to regulations. Commodities are primarily driven by their securities structure, since they are usually traded using futures contracts, but tend not to be heavily influenced by other structures. Operationally focused real assetsare dominated in size by land and real estate. Land and real estate has in majority the institutional structure of being privately held and traded. Infrastructure often includes heavy regulatory structures, while intellectual property often includes issues related to compensation structures.Investment Management'
 'Page 13: Investment Instruments and Vehicles Structures and Alternative Investment Types Alternative Investments 25/ 76 Hedge funds: are primarily driven by the trading structure: the use of active, complex, and proprietary trading strategies. are also distinguished by regulatory structures (e.g. the use of offshore structures due to tax regulations) and compensation structures, including the use of performance-based investment management fees. Private equity is clearly distinguished by the institutional structure that it is not publicly traded. Compensation, securities, and trading structures also play nontrivial roles in shaping the nature of private equity. Structured products areclearly distinguished by the securities structure.

Typically generates active risk (risk that causes a portfolio’s return to deviate from the return of a benchmark due to active management) and active return (the difference between the return of a portfolio and its benchmark that is due to active management). is the converse of passive investing that tends to focus on buying and holding securities in an effort to match the risk and return target, such as highly diversified index. is an important characteristic of almost all alternative investments.Investment Management Investment Instruments and Vehicles Goals of Alternative Investing Alternative Investments 34/ 762. Absolute and Relative Returns Absolute return standard means that returns are to be evaluated relative to zero, a fixed rate, or relative to the riskless rate, and therefore independently of performance of equity markets, debt markets, or any other markets. Relative return standard means that returns are to be evaluated relative to a benchmark.3. Arbitrage, Return Enhancers, and Risk Diversifiers Pure arbitrage is the attempt to earn risk-free profits through the simulteneours purchase and sale of identical positions trading at different prices in different markets. Return enhancer and return diversifier are investment products included in the portfolio because are believed to offer either a superior average return or a reduction in risk due to the lack of correlation.Investment Management'

Theoretical futures price is the equilibrium price at which no arbitrage  occurs. Cash and carry trades occurs when the investor sell an overpriced future, buys the underlying asset at borrowing rate and pockets an arbitrage profit. Reverse cash and carry trades occurs when the investor buys an underpriced future, shorts the underlying asset invests the money and pockets an arbitrage profit. Cost of carry is the (net financing) cost of holding a position and shows the link between the spot and the forward / futures.Derivatives F0=S0⋅e(r+u−q−y)TInvestment Management'

CDS is the most popular type of credit derivativesthat allows the transfer of credit risk to another party without the sale of the loan. CDS are conceptually a form of insurance that (used to) avoid the regulatory burden imposed to traditional credit insurance products. CDS are over-the-counter derivatives, although standardization (International Swap and Derivatives Association –ISDA documentation) and transparency (central clearing imposed by new OTC regulation) are new features of the contract. CDS are based on one reference entity (single-name CDS) or multiple entities (basket CDS) and can be settled either physically or in cash.Derivatives Investment Management'

 'Page 5: Return and Risk in Investment Concepts of Return and Risk in Investment Return is the level of profit from an investment (the reward for investing) and is computed as the sum of the income yield (distributions made by the company -cash or stock dividends or coupons) and the capital gain (loss) yield (difference between the sale price and the purchase price).  It is preferable to use percentage returns rather than dollar returns to allow for direct comparison of different sized and types of investments. Return is a fundamental element for both investors (evaluate an investment in terms of the return they expect to earn on it compared to a level of return viewed as fair given everything they know about the investment, including its risk) and analysts (need to specify the appropriate rate or rates with which to discount expected future cash flows when using present value models of stock value). Risk of an investment is defined as the uncertainty of its future returns and is often measured as the variance or standard deviation of the expected return of the equity security.Definition of Return and Risk 5/ 37Investment Management'

Return for an equity security (stock) can be separated into: dividend yield –distributions made by the company to its shareholders, such as cash or stock dividends (Dt); price appreciation return (or capital gain yield) –difference between the sale price at time t and the purchase price at time t-1.  If the share is purchased now (at t = 0) and sold at t = H, then:𝐻𝑃𝑅=𝑟=𝐷!+𝑃!𝑃"−1=𝐷!𝑃"+𝑃!−𝑃"𝑃" HPR are sometimes converted to an annualized return, usually based on compounding at the holding period rate.Measuring Return and Risk Investment Management'
 'Page 7: Return and Risk in Investment Realized and Expected Holding Period Return 7/ 37 A realized (holding periodic) return is a historical return based on past observed prices and cash flows.  An expected (holding periodic) return is based on forecasts of future prices and cash flows.  If for a HPR in the past, the selling price and the dividend are known, in a forward-looking context, HPRs are random variables because future prices and dividends may take a range of values.  Although professional investors often formulate expected returns based on explicit valuation models, a return expectation does not have to be based on a model or on specific valuation knowledge.  Any investor can have a personal viewpoint on the future returns on an asset and, because investors formulate expectations in varying ways and on the basis of different information, different investors generally have different expected returns for an asset.Measuring Return and Risk Investment Management'

 'Page 17: Return and Risk in Investment Required Rate of Return Measuring Return and Risk 17/ 37 A required (rate of) return is the minimum level of expected return that an investor requires in order to invest in the asset over a specified time period, given the asset’s riskiness.  It represents the opportunity cost for investing in the asset—the highest level of expected return available elsewhere from investments of similar risk.  As the opportunity cost for investing in the asset, the required return represents a threshold value for being fairly compensated for the risk of the asset. If the investor’s expected return exceeds the required return, the asset will appear to be undervalued because it is expected to return more-than-fair compensation for the asset’s risk.  The required rate of return on common stock and debt are also known as the cost of equity and cost of debt, respectively, taking the perspective of the issuer and is therefore the issuer’s marginal cost for raising additional capital of the same type.Investment Management'
 'Page 18: Return and Risk in Investment Expected and Realized Alpha Measuring Return and Risk 18/ 37 In investment decision-making and valuation, the focus is on expected (or ex ante) alpha or expected abnormal return.  Expected alpha = Expected return –Required return  When an asset is efficiently priced (price = intrinsic value), expected return should equal required return, and the expected alpha is zero.  To evaluate the actual results of an investment discipline, the analyst would examine realized alpha.  Realized alpha = Actual HPR –Contemporaneous required return  Expected return and required rate of return are sometimes used interchangeably, which is not necessarily correct. When current price equals perceived value, they should be the same. However, when price is below (above) the perceived value, expected return will exceed (be less than) the required return as long as the investor expects price to converge to value over his or her time horizon.Investment Management'

 'Page 20: Return and Risk in Investment Discount Rate Measuring Return and Risk 20/ 37 Discount rate is a general term for any rate used in finding the present value of a future cash flow.  A discount rate reflects the compensation required by investors for delaying consumption—generally assumed to equal the risk-free rate—and their required compensation for the risk of the cash flow.  Generally, the discount rate used to determine intrinsic value depends on the characteristics of the investment rather than on the characteristics of the purchaser. That is, for the purposes of estimating intrinsic value, a required return based on marketplace variables is used rather than a personal required return influenced by such factors as whether the investor is diversified in his or her personal portfolio.  In principle, a distinct discount rate could be applicable to each distinct expected future cash flow. Investment Management'
 'Page 21: Return and Risk in Investment Internal Rate of Return Measuring Return and Risk 21/ 37 The internal rate of return (IRR) on an investment is the discount rate that equates the present value of the asset’s expected future cash flows to the asset’s price—that is, the amount of money needed today to purchase a right to those cash flows.  In a model that views the intrinsic value of a common equity share as the present value of expected future cash flows, if price is equal to current intrinsic value—the condition of market informational efficiency—then, generally, a discount rate can be found, usually by iteration, which equates that present value to the market price.  An IRR computed under the assumption of market efficiency has been used to estimate the required return on equity; an example is the historical practice of many US state regulators of estimating the cost of equity for regulated utilities -regulators set prices sufficient for utilities to earn their cost of capital.Investment Management'
 'Page 22: Return and Risk in Investment CFA: Money-Weighted vs.Time-Weighted Rate of Return 22/ 37 The money-weighted rate of returnis defined as the internal rate of return on a portfolio, taking into account all cash inflows and outflows.  Beginning value of the account is an inflow, as are all deposits.  All withdrawals from the account are outflows, as is the ending value.  The time-weighted rate of return measures compound growth.  It is the rate at which $1 compounds over a specified performance horizon, time-weightingbeing the process of averaging a set of values over time.  The annual time-weighted return for an investment is computed in three steps: 1.Value the portfolio immediately preceding significant additions or withdrawals. Form subperiods over the evaluation period that correspond to the dates of deposits and withdrawals. 2.Compute the holding period return (HPR) of the portfolio for each subperiod. 3.Compute the product of (1 + HPR) for each subperiod to obtain a total return for the entire measurement period [i.e., (1 + HPR1) ×(1 + HPR2) ... (1 + HPRn)]. If the total investment period is greater than one year, take the geometric mean of the measurement period return to find the annual time-weighted rate of return.Measuring Return and Risk Investment Management'

Putable common or preferences shares are less risky than normal shares.  Callable shares are more risky than normal shares.  Cumulative preference shares have lower risk than non-cumulative.

 'Page 29: Return and Risk in Investment Equity Risk Premium Risk-Return Tradeoff 29/ 37 The equity risk premium (ERP) is the incremental return (premium) that investors require for holding equities rather than a risk-free asset; it is the difference between the required return on equities and a specified expected risk-free rate of return.  The equity risk premium, like the required return, depends strictly on expectations for the future because the investor’s returns depend only on the investment’s future cash flows.  Possibly confusingly, equity risk premium is also commonly used to refer to the realized excess return of stocks over a risk-free asset over a given past time period.  The realized excess return could be very different from the premium that, based on available information, was contemporaneously being expected by investors.Investment Management'

Time value of money is the difference in value between money today and money in the future. Interest rate(current)allows conversion of money from one point in time to another and, so, is like an exchange rate across time. When we express the value in terms of dollars today, we call it the present value(PV) of the investment. If we express it in terms of dollars in the future, we call it the future valueof the investment. The one-year discount factor is price today of $1 in one year.

 'Page 3: Return and Risk in Investment Time Value of Money, Compounding and Discounting 5/ 26 Time value of moneyrefers to the relationship of equivalence between cash flows occurring at different dates. Time value of money is a core principle in finance based on the idea that users of the financial system value more the cash flows available at present time than the same amount at a future time due to their potential capacity of earning interest. Time value of money concepts help us: Compute the value today of a single future cash flow, a series of equally sized future cash flows or a series of unequally sized future cash flows; Compute the value in the future of a single cash flow, a series of equally sized future cash flows or a series of unequally sized future cash flows.

 'Page 8: Modern Portfolio Theory Types of Risk 15/ 35 Common risk is the risk that is perfectly correlated (e.g. risk of earthquakes in earthquake insurance), whilst the independent risks are the risks that share no correlation (e.g. risk of theft in theft insurance).  Over any given period, the risk of holding a stock is that the dividends plus the final stock price will be higher or lower than expected, which makes the realized return risky.  Total risk of a security represents both idiosyncratic and systematic risk:  Idiosyncratic risk (firm-specific, unique or diversifiable risk) is the variation in a stock’s return due to firm-specific news (good or bad news about the company itself) and is the risk that is independent of other shocks in the economy.  Systematic risk (market or undiversifiable risk) is the risk due to market-wide news (news about the economy as a whole) that affects all stocks simultaneously and is the risk common to all stocks.Diversification and Risk Premium Investment Management Modern Portfolio Theory Return and Risk –Questions for a financial analyst 16/ 351.

 'Page 10: Modern Portfolio Theory Return and Risk –Questions for a financial analyst 19/ 352. Answer Quantitative Check Investment Management Modern Portfolio Theory Diversification and Risk Premium 20/ 35 The risk premium for diversifiable risk is zero, so investors are not compensated for holding firm-specific risk.  Because investors can eliminate idiosyncratic risk for free by diversifying their portfolio, they do not require a reward or risk premium for taking it on.  The risk premium of a stock is not affected by its diversifiable risk. The risk premium of a security is determined by its systematic risk and does not depend on its diversifiable risk.  Because investors cannot eliminate systematic risk, they must be compensated for holding it.  A stock’s volatility, which is a measure of total risk (systematic risk plus diversifiable risk), is not especially useful in determining the risk premium that investors will earn.

 'Page 13: Modern Portfolio Theory Traditional versus Modern Portfolio Management Individual and institutional investors currently use two approaches to plan and construct their portfolios: Traditional approach refers to the less quantitative methods and is used since the evolution of the public securities markets.   Modern portfolio theory (MPT)is a more mathematical approach that relies on quantitative analysis to guide investment decisions.  Traditional portfolio management emphasizes balancing the portfolio by assembling a  wide variety of stocks and/or bonds. The typical emphasis is interindustry diversification that produces a portfolio with securities of companies from a broad range of industries.  In traditional portfolio management investment occurs typically in stocks of well-known companies for three reasons:(a) less risk; (b) higher liquidity; (c) easiness in convincing clients (window dressing).25/ 35Portfolio Theory & Pricing of Risk Investment Management Modern Portfolio Theory Markowitz & the Modern Portfolio Theory Harry Markowitzdeveloped in 1950s the theories that form the basis of modern portfolio theory. Modern portfolio theory (MPT) uses several basic statistical measures to  develop a portfolio plan.  Portfolios formed using MPT principles estimate the average returns, standard deviations, and correlations among many combinations of  investments to find an optimal portfolio.  According to MPT, the maximum benefits of diversification occur when investors find securities that are relatively uncorrelated and put those securities together in a portfolio.  To determine the optimal portfolio, the modern portfolio theory finds the efficient frontier and couples it with an investor’s risk-indifference curves.26/ 35Portfolio Theory & Pricing of Risk Investment Management'
 'Page 14: Modern Portfolio Theory Modern Portfolio Theory Concepts Mean-Variance Analysis (MVA)assumes that investors are mean-variance optimizers. Feasible (attainable) set –the set of mean and standard deviation outcomes. Efficient (dominating) portfolio –a portfolio that provides the highest return for a given level of risk. Efficient set / frontier–the collection of all portfolios with the highest expected return of all feasible portfolios with the same level of risk. Dominated portfolios–lie below and to the right of some other feasible portfolios. Minimum variance portfolio –the efficient portfolio with the minimum risk. Optimal portfolio –maximizes an investor’s preferences with respect to return and risk. Investor’s indifference curves –curves that indicate, for a given level of utility (satisfaction), the set of risk-return combinations about which an investor would be indifferent.27/ 35Portfolio Theory & Pricing of Risk Investment Management Modern Portfolio Theory MPT: Feasible, Efficient and Optimal Portfolios 28/ 35Portfolio Theory & Pricing of Risk Investment Management'
 'Page 15: Modern Portfolio Theory Efficient Portfolios and Systematic Risk An efficient portfoliocontains only systematic risk and cannot be diversified further –that is, there is no way to reduce the risk of the portfolio without lowering its expected return. Portfolio betas can be used to develop efficient portfolios consistent with the investor’s risk-return preferences.  Portfolio betas are merely a weighted average of the betas of the individual assets  in the portfolio.  Generally, investors use elements of  both the traditional approach and MPT to create portfolios -involves determining how much risk you are willing to bear, seeking diversification, using beta to diversify your portfolio, and evaluating  alternative portfolios to select the one that offers the  highest return for an acceptable level of risk.βP=wiβii=1N∑29/ 35Portfolio Theory & Pricing of Risk Investment Management Modern Portfolio Theory 30/ 35Modern Portfolio Theory –Question Portfolio Theory & Pricing of Risk Investment Management'

Explain your answer.Portfolio Theory & Pricing of Risk Investment Management Modern Portfolio Theory 32/ 35d.Point T identifies the tangency portfolio, and the line connecting the risk-free return with point Tis designated as the capital market line (CML). Besides these two concepts, CAPM also includes those of market portfolio (denoted by M) and securities market line (SML). Is there any difference between T and M? What about CML and SML? Are they different? Explain your answers.e.Assume that the returns of the two stocks discussed above are perfectly positively correlated (A) and perfectly negatively correlated (B) with those of the market portfolio (M).If the variance of the returns of the market portfolio is 25 pp 2and the standard deviations of returns of stocks Aand Bare 10%, and 2%, respectively, what would be the amount of systematic risk of a portfolio consisting of £4.000 of stock Aand £6.000 of stock B?Could you reduce (or even virtually eliminate) this portion of the portfolio’s risk by just adding more stocks (“eggs in the basket”)?f.Use the Bloomberg adjustment for the portfolio beta and determine the annualized expected return required by investors in the portfolio as estimated from the CAPM, if the daily return of the stock index (proxy for the market portfolio) is 0.05% and the zero-beta return is 5.00%. Is this portfolio located on the SML? Explain your answer.Next time: MPT & CAPM –(Additional) Question Portfolio Theory & Pricing of Risk Investment Management'
